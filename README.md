# Java Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Java. The aim is to provide clear and concise examples to help understand and apply these patterns in your projects.

## Implemented Design Patterns

Below is a list of the design patterns currently implemented in this repository:

* **Abstract Factory:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **Adapter:** Allows interfaces of incompatible classes to work together by providing a wrapper.
* **Decorator:** Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object by wrapping it in a decorator.
* **Factory:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
* **Mediator:** Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from explicitly referring to each other.
* **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
* **Singleton:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
